    I really just wanted to monitor my hard drive usage, VPN, and
    maybe temperatures!?

      nano ~/.ssh/config on computer running conky & add
    
           Host coreelec
           User root
           Hostname 'from /etc/hosts (e.g. coreelec)'
           ControlMaster auto
           ControlPath  ~/.ssh/sockets/master-coreelec
           ControlPersist 600
    
    
   prints output in order of options <fewer options faster time / less load>
   
   run: time ssh Hostname /path/to/coreelec-conky.sh -[ocltumeqirxsdfp] >/dev/null
   to determine 'interval' & add the following to your conky config:
   
   ${texecpi 'interval' ssh Hostname /path/to/coreelec-conky.sh -[ocltumeqirxsdfp]}
   
   add 'UseDNS no' to /storage/.cache/services/sshd.conf on CoreELEC
   
   alignment and cpu format can be changed from the command line
     pass [left|center|right|horiz] for alignment
     pass [long|longer|longest] for frequency, per core, and a graph
   
   to remove all nonindented (debug) lines after this heading
     sed -i -e '61,$ { /^[^[:blank:]]/d }' /opt/bin/coreelec-conky.sh
